# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
`Outside promise` would print first because it is synchronous code which always prints before asynchronous code
